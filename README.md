# hol-light-docker
Scripts for HOL Light (installation, deployment, checkpointing) on Docker.

## Remark
Simplified version of <https://github.com/maggesi/hol-light-docker>. This version only supports the hol-light core libaray but makes the installion simpler overall. If you need Multivariate analysis, Complex analysis or Quaternions than please use maggesi version.
